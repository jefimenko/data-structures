Code Fellows Dev Accelerator: This repository will be for implementations of classic data structures in python.


parens.py:
Includes a function balanceness() that takes string and determines if it is 'open', 'balanced', or 'broken', depending on the sequence of parenthesis contained. 'Open', 'balanced', and 'broken' are respectively determined as more leading '('s than ')'s, equal number of leading '(' and ')', and any sequence including ')' that do not have a preceding '('. 'Open' strings are represented by returning a 1, 'balanced' by 0, and 'broken' by -1, with an emptry string being considered 'balanced'.
